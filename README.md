## 📝 Contributing

This is a personal knowledge management system, but the structure and approach may be useful for others building similar systems.

### Key Principles
- **Everything Connects**: Ideas are linked across domains
- **Tradeoffs Are Universal**: Every choice involves opportunity costs
- **Judgment Becomes Scarce**: Human value shifts to knowing what's worth doing
- **Under Construction**: Knowledge evolves; these capture thinking in progress

## 🔗 Cross-References

The system uses extensive internal linking between notes. Link format: `[Note Title](filename.md)`

## 📊 Metadata

Each note includes:
- **Tags**: Domain classification and topic keywords
- **Created**: Original creation date
- **Relationships**: Connections to other notes
- **Article Potential**: Ideas for public writing

## 🏷️ Tags

Notes are organized using domain-based tags:
- `ai`, `energy`, `politics`, `productivity`
- `neurodiversity`, `health`, `technology`, `writing`
- Plus specific topic tags for granular organization
