## Core Philosophy

This knowledge system operates on several key principles:

**🔗 Everything Connects** • Ideas don't exist in isolation. The most valuable insights emerge at the intersections.

**⚖️ Tradeoffs Are Universal** • Every choice involves opportunity costs. Maturity means accepting this reality.

**🎯 Judgment Becomes Scarce** • As execution becomes automated, human value shifts to knowing what's worth doing.

**🏗️ Under Construction** • Knowledge is always evolving. These notes capture thinking in progress.
