# Climate often against humans

Natural climate patterns, even without human influence, frequently create conditions hostile to human survival. Historical floods, droughts, storms, and fires killed more people in the past because humans lacked the technological tools to defend themselves effectively.

## Bibliography

- Epstein, Alex. *Fossil Future: Why Global Human Flourishing Requires More Oil, Coal, and Natural Gas - Not Less*

## Relationships
- **Supports**: [Planet Earth unfriendly to humans](energy-earth-hostile-environment.md) - provides specific examples of natural climate threats
- **Supports**: [We need machines to live](energy-machines-survival.md) - explains why climate protection requires technology
- **Conflicts**: [Climate change secondary effects](energy-climate-secondary-effects.md) - distinguishes between natural climate hostility and human-caused changes
- **Related**: [Infrastructure makes Earth habitable](energy-infrastructure-habitable.md)
- **Examples**: Pre-industrial flood mortality, historical fire devastation, crop failures from weather variability
- **Extends to**: Disaster preparedness, climate adaptation technology, weather prediction systems

## Article Potential
- **Angle**: Challenge the romanticization of pre-industrial climate by showing historical climate-related mortality
- **Hook**: "Nature was killing us long before we started changing the climate"
- **After reading**: Readers understand that climate has always been a human challenge, not just a modern problem
- **Evidence needed**: Historical mortality data from natural disasters, comparison of pre-industrial vs. modern climate death rates
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments that human activity has made natural climate more dangerous

## Article 2 Potential
- **Angle**: Explore how climate adaptation technology represents human evolutionary advantage
- **Hook**: "How we evolved from climate victims to climate managers"
- **After reading**: Readers see climate technology as natural human adaptation rather than "unnatural" intervention
- **Evidence needed**: Timeline of climate adaptation technologies, success stories of disaster mitigation
- **Counter-arguments**: Address concerns about technological hubris and unintended consequences

## Cross-Domain Connections
- **Politics**: Climate adaptation vs. mitigation policy debates, disaster relief funding
- **Health**: Climate-related health impacts, heat stress, cold exposure mortality
- **Technology**: Weather prediction, early warning systems, climate-controlled environments
