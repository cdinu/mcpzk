# Technology Hub - Synthesis & Patterns

## Core Insights

1. **The Purity-Testability Connection**: Pure functions create predictable, reliable code because they eliminate hidden dependencies and side effects, making both testing and reasoning dramatically easier.

2. **The Order Independence Principle**: Pure functions don't care about execution sequence, enabling parallel processing, functional composition, and mathematical reasoning about code behavior.

3. **The Contamination Reality**: Impurity spreads through function call chains, requiring careful architectural boundaries to maintain system predictability and testability.

## Key Patterns

- **Purity vs. Contamination**: Pure functions remain pure only until they call impure functions
- **Testing vs. Complexity**: Function purity directly correlates with testing ease and system reliability
- **Order vs. Independence**: Pure functions enable parallel execution and mathematical reasoning
- **Composition vs. Side Effects**: Functional composition requires purity for predictable behavior
