# Security Theatre Creates False Safety Perception

Security theatre involves implementing security measures that provide the feeling of improved safety without actually delivering meaningful protection, often diverting resources from genuinely effective security practices.

## Core Characteristics

**Perception Over Protection**: Measures designed to make people feel safer rather than be safer
**Visible vs. Effective**: Emphasis on conspicuous security displays over hidden but effective measures
**Compliance Focus**: Following security protocols regardless of their actual effectiveness
**Cost-Benefit Inversion**: Expensive visible measures often less effective than cheaper invisible ones

## Common Examples

**Airport Security**: Many TSA procedures provide minimal security benefit but create appearance of thoroughness
**Corporate Policies**: Password complexity requirements that encourage poor password practices
**Physical Security**: Lobby security guards who cannot actually prevent determined attackers
**Hygiene Theatre**: COVID-19 cleaning protocols that targeted surfaces instead of airborne transmission

## Systemic Problems

**Resource Misallocation**: Limited security budgets spent on theatre instead of effective measures
**False Confidence**: People take unnecessary risks believing they are protected
**Opportunity Cost**: Real security improvements delayed or ignored in favor of visible ones
**Institutional Momentum**: Theatre becomes institutionalized and resistant to evidence-based reform

**Related**: [Public discourse ignores fossil fuel benefits](energy-fossil-benefits-ignored.md)
*Rationale*: Both involve policy measures that prioritize appearance over effectiveness

**Supports**: [Politicians influence climate discourse](energy-politicians-influence-climate.md)
*Rationale*: Political incentives favor visible action over effective but invisible measures

**Conflicts**: [DRI system works phenomenally](productivity-dri-system-works.md)
*Rationale*: Clear accountability would expose security theatre's lack of effectiveness
