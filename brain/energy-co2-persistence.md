# CO2 persists thousands of years

Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for thousands of years after emission. Even if humanity stopped all emissions in 2100, approximately 20-35% of a large carbon pulse would remain after 2000 years, and 12-22% would still be present after 10,000 years.

## Relationships
- **Supports**: [CO2 emissions affect world everywhere](energy-co2-global-impact.md) - explains why global coordination matters: effects are permanent and global
- **Supports**: [Climate change secondary effects](energy-climate-secondary-effects.md) - shows why long-term planning is necessary
- **Related**: [Energy involves cost-climate tradeoffs](energy-cost-climate-tradeoffs.md)
- **Examples**: Medieval warming period CO2 still affecting climate, Industrial Revolution emissions still present
- **Extends to**: Intergenerational justice, long-term climate commitments, irreversibility of climate policy

## Article Potential
- **Angle**: Explore the intergenerational ethics of permanent environmental changes
- **Hook**: "The CO2 you emit today will outlive your great-great-grandchildren"
- **After reading**: Readers understand the permanence of climate decisions and their ethical implications
- **Evidence needed**: Climate modeling data, intergenerational impact analysis, ethical framework comparisons
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments about future technological solutions for CO2 removal

## Article 2 Potential
- **Angle**: Examine how permanence changes cost-benefit analysis of climate policy
- **Hook**: "When environmental decisions can't be undone"
- **After reading**: Readers understand how irreversibility affects policy analysis and decision-making frameworks
- **Evidence needed**: Decision theory research on irreversible choices, policy analysis frameworks, option value calculations
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments about uncertainty justifying delay

## Cross-Domain Connections
- **Politics**: Intergenerational justice, long-term policy planning, democratic time horizons
- **Health**: Long-term health impacts, chronic vs. acute environmental effects
- **Productivity**: Long-term investment decisions, irreversible technology choices
