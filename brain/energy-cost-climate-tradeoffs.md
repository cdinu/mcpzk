# Energy involves cost-climate tradeoffs

Energy choices involve complex tradeoffs between economic costs and climate impacts, with no perfect solutions that optimize both dimensions simultaneously. Different energy sources present different combinations of costs and environmental effects.

## Bibliography

- Personal analysis

## Relationships
- **Supports**: [Public discourse ignores fossil benefits](energy-discourse-fossil-benefits.md) - shows why complete cost-benefit analysis is needed
- **Supports**: [Fossil is most accessible energy source](energy-fossil-accessible.md) - explains one dimension of the tradeoff (accessibility vs. emissions)
- **Related**: [Manufacturing emissions exceed usage emissions](energy-manufacturing-emissions.md), [Airships could reduce transport emissions](energy-airships-transport.md)
- **Examples**: Solar panels requiring rare earth mining, wind turbines affecting bird populations, nuclear waste storage, fossil fuel air pollution
- **Extends to**: Technology selection frameworks, policy analysis methods, investment decision criteria

## Article Potential
- **Angle**: Develop framework for honest comparison of energy tradeoffs without ideological bias
- **Hook**: "The energy choice that doesn't exist: cheap, clean, and reliable"
- **After reading**: Readers understand how to evaluate energy options systematically rather than emotionally
- **Evidence needed**: Comprehensive cost-benefit analysis across energy sources, lifecycle assessment methodology, decision framework examples
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments that some energy sources are clearly superior across all dimensions

## Article 2 Potential
- **Angle**: Explore how different values lead to different optimal energy choices
- **Hook**: "Why energy experts disagree: it's not about facts"
- **After reading**: Readers understand how value priorities (cost, environment, reliability) determine optimal energy choices
- **Evidence needed**: Value elicitation studies, preference analysis, multicriteria decision analysis examples
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments that objective analysis should determine energy policy

## Cross-Domain Connections
- **Politics**: Energy policy, environmental regulation, economic development priorities
- **Productivity**: Decision-making frameworks, optimization methods, resource allocation
- **Health**: Health impact assessment, environmental health economics
