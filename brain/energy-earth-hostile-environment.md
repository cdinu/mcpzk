# Planet Earth unfriendly to humans

Without infrastructure and technology, Earth presents numerous threats to human survival at both macro and micro scales. Natural predators, diseases, pathogens, and natural disasters make the planet inherently challenging for human habitation.

## Bibliography

- Epstein, Alex. *Fossil Future: Why Global Human Flourishing Requires More Oil, Coal, and Natural Gas - Not Less*

## Relationships
- **Supports**: [Infrastructure makes Earth habitable](energy-infrastructure-habitable.md) - explains why infrastructure development is necessary for survival
- **Supports**: [Climate often against humans](energy-climate-hostile.md) - provides broader context for climate-specific threats
- **Related**: [We need machines to live](energy-machines-survival.md)
- **Examples**: Disease outbreaks in areas lacking medical infrastructure, predator attacks in unprotected areas, exposure deaths in extreme climates
- **Extends to**: Space exploration challenges, deep ocean environment hostility, extreme climate zones

## Article Potential
- **Angle**: Challenge the romantic "return to nature" narrative by examining actual natural conditions
- **Hook**: "Earth: The planet that's trying to kill you"
- **After reading**: Readers appreciate how technology and infrastructure protect them from natural threats
- **Evidence needed**: Historical mortality data from natural causes, current statistics from less developed regions, specific examples of natural threats
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments about human adaptation and indigenous survival strategies

## Article 2 Potential
- **Angle**: Explore how humans transformed from prey to apex predator through technology
- **Hook**: "From hunted to hunter: humanity's technological evolution"
- **After reading**: Readers understand human technology as evolutionary adaptation rather than environmental destruction
- **Evidence needed**: Evolutionary biology research, anthropological evidence of technology adoption, comparative species analysis
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments about ecological balance and human overreach

## Cross-Domain Connections
- **Health**: Disease prevention, medical infrastructure, public health systems
- **Technology**: Environmental monitoring, protection systems, habitat control
- **Politics**: Environmental regulation, development vs. conservation policies
