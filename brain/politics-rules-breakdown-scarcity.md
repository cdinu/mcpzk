# Rules breakdown resource scarcity

When resources become scarce, social rules and civilized behavior break down. Even in supposedly civilized societies like the UK, scarcity reveals that behavioral norms are contingent on adequate resource availability.

## Bibliography

- Personal observation (Hart Leisure Centre parking situation, 09/02/2025)

## Relationships
- **Supports**: [State of shock societal](politics-societal-shock.md) - provides concrete example of how shock leads to social breakdown
