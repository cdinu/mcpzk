# Energy feudalism concentrates infrastructure control

Energy feudalism describes transitions where control of physical infrastructures (grids, microgrids, renewables) and digital platforms (data, markets, software) concentrates in a few hands, creating dependency, lock-in, rent extraction, and stratified access to reliable energy.

## Core Mechanisms

**Balkanized Governance**: Western U.S. grids operate as "feudal kingdoms" with fragmented control structures
**Platformization**: Digital energy platforms set market rules, capture valuable data, and extract rents from participants
**Colonial Patterns**: Renewable energy siting and post-disaster control reproduce historical extractive relationships
**Two-Tier Reliability**: Private microgrid growth creates stratified energy security for different economic classes
**Market Rentierism**: Liberalized energy markets prioritize profit extraction over public value creation

## Feudal Characteristics in Energy Systems

**Dependency Relations**: Users become dependent on infrastructure owners rather than having democratic control
**Lock-in Effects**: Switching costs and technical barriers prevent users from changing energy providers
**Rent Extraction**: Infrastructure owners capture value without creating proportional benefits
**Stratified Access**: Energy reliability becomes correlated with ability to pay rather than universal service
**Concentrated Control**: Small number of actors control critical infrastructure decisions

## Evidence and Examples

**Grid Governance**: Western U.S. electricity grids described as "feudal kingdoms" in academic literature
**Platform Power**: Digital energy companies control market access and data flows
**Microgrid Inequality**: Wealthy communities develop private energy systems while others remain vulnerable
**Renewable Colonialism**: Large-scale renewable projects extract resources from rural communities for urban benefit
**Market Concentration**: Energy liberalization leads to oligopolistic control rather than competitive markets

## Implications for Energy Transition

**Democratic Deficit**: Energy transition controlled by private interests rather than public planning
**Justice Concerns**: Benefits and burdens of clean energy transition distributed unequally
**Resilience Paradox**: Private solutions improve individual resilience while undermining collective resilience
**Public Interest**: Market-driven transition may not align with broader social goals
