# CO2 emissions affect world everywhere

Carbon dioxide emissions from any location affect the global atmosphere, meaning individual country efforts have limited impact. Even if one nation completely eliminates greenhouse gas emissions, the global impact would be single-digit percentages, creating a collective action problem.

## Relationships
- **Supports**: [Climate discourse influenced by politicians](energy-discourse-political.md) - explains why international coordination is politically challenging
- **Conflicts**: [Climate change secondary effects](energy-climate-secondary-effects.md) - global nature makes local solutions insufficient for broader impacts
- **Related**: [Public discourse ignores fossil benefits](energy-discourse-fossil-benefits.md)
- **Examples**: China's emissions growth offsetting European reductions, developing nations' industrialization patterns
- **Extends to**: International climate agreements, carbon trading systems, global governance challenges

## Article Potential
- **Angle**: Explore the game theory and collective action problems in climate policy
- **Hook**: "Why your country's climate sacrifice might be meaningless"
- **After reading**: Readers understand the mathematical and political challenges of global climate coordination
- **Evidence needed**: Analysis of emission reduction impacts by country, game theory models of climate cooperation
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments for moral leadership and technology development spillovers

## Article 2 Potential
- **Angle**: Examine whether global problems require global solutions or can be solved locally
- **Hook**: "When local action meets global problems: the CO2 paradox"
- **After reading**: Readers understand the scale mismatch between local policy and global problems
- **Evidence needed**: Case studies of local environmental action vs. global outcomes, policy effectiveness research
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments about cumulative effects and technology diffusion

## Cross-Domain Connections
- **Politics**: International relations, sovereignty vs. global governance, treaty enforcement
- **Technology**: Carbon capture technology, monitoring systems, satellite measurement
- **Productivity**: Economic efficiency of global vs. local climate policies
