# Fossil is most accessible energy source for infrastructure

Fossil fuels remain the most accessible energy source for large-scale infrastructure due to their unique combination of storability, transportability, on-demand availability, and high energy density. These characteristics make them particularly suited for applications requiring reliable, scalable power delivery.
