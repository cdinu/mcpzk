# Public discourse ignores fossil benefits

Climate change discussions systematically exclude consideration of the benefits that fossil fuels provide to humanity, focusing exclusively on costs and problems. This creates an incomplete cost-benefit analysis that ignores the positive impacts of fossil energy on human welfare and development.

- **Supports**: [Fossil is most accessible energy source](energy-fossil-accessible.md) - provides examples of benefits being ignored
- **Conflicts**: [Air pollution from energy shortens lives](energy-pollution-health-impact.md) - shows real costs that discourse does acknowledge

## Article Potential
- **Angle**: Expose the systematic bias in how energy trade-offs are discussed in public discourse
- **Hook**: "What if we talked about cars the way we talk about fossil fuels?"
- **After reading**: Readers recognize how selective focus distorts energy policy discussions
- **Evidence needed**: Content analysis of climate discourse, examples of ignored benefits, comparison with other technology discussions
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments that benefits are obvious and don't need emphasis

## Article 2 Potential
- **Angle**: Explore how moral framing prevents rational cost-benefit analysis
- **Hook**: "When saving the planet means ignoring human welfare"
- **After reading**: Readers understand how moral certainty can block analytical thinking
- **Evidence needed**: Psychology research on moral reasoning vs. analytical thinking, policy analysis comparing different frameworks
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments that moral considerations should override economic analysis
