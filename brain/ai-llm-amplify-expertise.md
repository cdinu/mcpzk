# LLMs amplify existing expertise

LLMs provide exponential leverage to experts who already understand the domain, enabling them to accomplish complex tasks faster while requiring deep existing knowledge to prompt effectively and evaluate results accurately.

## Expertise Requirements for LLM Success

**Domain Knowledge**: 25+ years of coding experience enables effective prompting and result evaluation
**Tool Familiarity**: Previous exploration of GitHub Actions, Pages, and LLM tools provides context for effective use
**Confidence Assessment**: Experienced practitioners know what's possible and can design appropriate tasks
**Quality Control**: Expertise enables bug detection and course correction during LLM-assisted work

## Why Expertise Matters for LLM Leverage

**Prompt Quality**: Effective prompts require understanding of domain constraints and possibilities
**Result Evaluation**: Experts can quickly identify when LLM output is correct, incomplete, or wrong
**Task Decomposition**: Breaking complex problems into LLM-manageable pieces requires domain understanding
**Design Authority**: Experts can dictate design decisions rather than relying on LLM creativity

## Amplification vs. Democratization

**Expert Acceleration**: LLMs make skilled practitioners dramatically more productive
**Novice Limitations**: Beginners lack context to prompt effectively or evaluate results
**Gap Widening**: Productivity gains concentrate among those who already have expertise
**Barrier Persistence**: LLMs don't eliminate the need for deep domain knowledge

## Implications for Professional Development

**Expertise Premium**: Existing skills become more valuable, not less
**Learning Strategy**: Building deep knowledge remains essential for LLM leverage
**Competitive Advantage**: Expert-LLM combinations outperform both standalone experts and novice-LLM combinations
**Career Investment**: Professional experience directly translates to AI productivity gains
