# AI writing like forklift in gym

Using ChatGPT for writing assignments is like bringing a forklift into the weight room - you will never improve your cognitive fitness that way. The hundreds of small decisions in writing (syntax, vocabulary, style) are as important as initial conception for developing thinking skills.

## Bibliography

- Ted Chiang, article on art and generative AI

## Relationships
- **Supports**: [LLMs decrease cognitive fitness](ai-cognitive-fitness-decline.md) - provides concrete analogy for cognitive exercise concept
- **Supports**: [GenAI reduces critical thinking](ai-critical-thinking-decline.md) - shows specific mechanism through which AI affects thinking
- **Related**: [AI skill leverage increases](ai-skill-leverage-amplifies.md) - contrasts cognitive development with productivity gains
- **Examples**: Student essay writing, academic research assistance, creative writing tools, professional communication
- **Extends to**: Educational technology design, cognitive skill development, human-AI collaboration

## Article Potential

- **Hook**: "Why the hard way is often the right way: lessons from the gym for the AI age"
- **After reading**: Readers understand that cognitive difficulty has intrinsic value for development
- **Evidence needed**: Learning science research on desirable difficulties, neuroplasticity studies, skill acquisition research
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments that AI frees time for more important cognitive work

## Article 2 Potential
- **Angle**: Explore how to design AI tools that provide assistance without eliminating cognitive exercise
- **Hook**: "The personal trainer approach to AI: assistance that makes you stronger"
- **After reading**: Readers understand design principles for cognitively beneficial AI tools
