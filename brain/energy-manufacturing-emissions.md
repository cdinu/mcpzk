## Relationships
- **Related**: [Servers at high utilization greenest](energy-servers-efficiency.md) - both focus on optimizing resource use rather than just avoiding use
- **Supports**: [Energy involves cost-climate tradeoffs](energy-cost-climate-tradeoffs.md) - adds complexity to simple use-reduction strategies
- **Examples**: Electronics manufacturing, automobile production, building construction, renewable energy equipment production
- **Extends to**: Supply chain optimization, product durability strategies, circular economy principles

## Article Potential
- **Angle**: Challenge the focus on usage efficiency by highlighting manufacturing's hidden carbon footprint
- **Hook**: "Why buying less might matter more than using less"
- **After reading**: Readers understand the importance of product lifecycle thinking in environmental decisions
- **Evidence needed**: Lifecycle analysis data across product categories, manufacturing vs. usage emission comparisons
