# GenZ prefers benefits over work UK

In the UK, Generation Z increasingly prefers benefits over work due to low wages, unaffordable housing, destroyed healthcare, massive debt burdens, and concentration of productivity gains among the super-rich. Work no longer provides path to homeownership, family formation, or retirement.
