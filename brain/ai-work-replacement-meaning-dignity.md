# AI work replacement requires meaning, dignity and economic security

When AI replaces human jobs, displaced workers need more than just money. The new employment must provide meaning, dignity, and economic security together - financial compensation alone is insufficient for human fulfillment and social stability.

## Core Requirements

**Meaning**: Work that provides sense of purpose and contribution to society
**Dignity**: Roles that maintain self-respect and social standing 
**Economic Security**: Financial stability that meets life needs reliably

## Why Money Alone Fails

**Identity Connection**: Work shapes personal and social identity beyond income
**Social Status**: Employment affects community standing and self-worth
**Purpose Fulfillment**: Humans require sense of contribution and value creation
**Structure Provision**: Work provides routine, goals, and social connection

## Transition Challenges

**Skill Mismatch**: Truck drivers' expertise may not transfer to available alternative roles
**Status Reduction**: New jobs may carry lower social prestige than skilled driving
**Purpose Gap**: Automated logistics may eliminate sense of essential contribution
**Security Uncertainty**: New economy jobs may offer less stability than traditional roles
