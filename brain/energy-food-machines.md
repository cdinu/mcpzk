# Energy is food for machines

Machines require energy to operate, much like how living organisms require food for sustenance. This fundamental analogy highlights the critical role energy plays in powering the infrastructure that modern civilization depends on.

## Bibliography

- Epstein, Alex. *Fossil Future: Why Global Human Flourishing Requires More Oil, Coal, and Natural Gas - Not Less*

## Relationships
- **Supports**: [Fossil is most accessible energy source](energy-fossil-accessible.md) - provides the foundational understanding of why specific energy sources matter
- **Supports**: [We need machines to live](energy-machines-survival.md) - establishes why machine operation is critical for human survival
- **Supports**: [Infrastructure makes Earth habitable](energy-infrastructure-habitable.md) - shows how energy powers the infrastructure we depend on
- **Related**: [Energy involves cost-climate tradeoffs](energy-cost-climate-tradeoffs.md)
- **Examples**: Medical equipment, heating/cooling systems, transportation, communication networks
- **Extends to**: Industrial production, agricultural machinery, water treatment systems

## Article Potential
- **Angle**: Using biological metaphors to explain energy policy helps non-technical audiences understand complex systems
- **Hook**: "Just as your body shuts down without food, our civilization stops working without energy"
- **After reading**: Readers gain intuitive understanding of energy's role in modern life and infrastructure dependency
- **Evidence needed**: Statistics on energy consumption by sector, examples of infrastructure failures during energy shortages
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments that compare energy consumption to overconsumption/obesity in biological systems

## Cross-Domain Connections
- **Technology**: Powers all digital infrastructure and computing systems
- **Health**: Medical equipment, hospital operations, pharmaceutical manufacturing
- **Politics**: Energy security as national security issue
- **Productivity**: Industrial output and economic productivity depend on reliable energy
