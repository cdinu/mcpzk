You can access via filesystem Model Context Protocol a zettlekasten-like knowledge management, found in the `/brain` path.

1. Read all the files. Ignore _llm_instructions_
2. Update all hub-synthesis files to reflect the contens of the notes (as new ones have been added)
3. Create a `__start__.md` that is a welcome page for this repository
4. Create an `_summary_.md` that can make you more efficient when I will ask you to add new ideas/topics/files. When adding new ideas, you need to look at the structure and update

Use git to commit before every step so that a history is kept properly.
