# Knowledge System Summary & Maintenance Guide

This document provides a structural overview of the knowledge system to facilitate efficient updates and maintenance when adding new ideas, topics, or files.

## System Structure Overview

### **Hub Synthesis Files (8 domains)**
These are the primary organizing documents that synthesize insights within each domain:

| Domain | File | Last Updated | Note Count |
|--------|------|--------------|------------|
| AI | `ai-hub-synthesis.md` | 2025-08-19 | 12 |
| Energy | `energy-hub-synthesis.md` | 2025-08-19 | 21 |
| Politics | `politics-hub-synthesis.md` | 2025-08-18 | 24 |
| Productivity | `productivity-hub-synthesis.md` | 2025-08-18 | 8 |
| Neurodiversity | `neurodiversity-hub-synthesis.md` | 2025-08-18 | 5 |
| Health | `health-hub-synthesis.md` | 2025-08-18 | 3 |
| Technology | `technology-hub-synthesis.md` | 2025-08-18 | 4 |

## Update Workflow for New Content

### **Adding New Individual Notes**
1. **Create file** with proper naming convention: `{domain}-{descriptive-topic}.md`
2. **Include standard frontmatter**: tags, creation date
3. **Write core content** with Bibliography, Relationships, Article Potential, Cross-Domain Connections
4. **Update relevant hub synthesis** to include new note in Supporting Notes section
5. **Consider cross-domain connections** and update `meta-hub-cross-domain.md` if applicable
6. **Commit changes** with descriptive message

### **Adding New Domains** 
1. **Create hub synthesis file**: `{domain}-hub-synthesis.md`
2. **Update `__start__.md`** to include new domain
3. **Update this summary** to document the new domain
4. **Consider cross-domain patterns** and update meta-hub accordingly

### **Updating Hub Syntheses**
Hub synthesis files should be updated when:
- New notes are added to a domain
- Existing notes reveal new patterns
- Cross-domain connections emerge
- Research gaps are identified
- Article opportunities evolve

**Update checklist for hub files:**
- [ ] Core Insights (3-4 fundamental principles)
- [ ] Key Patterns (recurring themes)
- [ ] Emerging Arguments & Article Opportunities 
- [ ] Research Gaps identified
- [ ] Cross-Domain Bridges documented
- [ ] Supporting Notes section updated with new files
- [ ] Updated timestamp in frontmatter

### **Maintenance Best Practices**

**Regular Reviews:**
- **Monthly**: Review new notes and update hub syntheses
- **Quarterly**: Look for emerging cross-domain patterns
- **Annually**: Major structural review and reorganization

**Quality Standards:**
- Every note should connect to at least 2 other notes
- Hub syntheses should reflect current content accurately
- Cross-domain connections should be bidirectional
- Article opportunities should include hooks and counter-arguments
- Sources should be properly attributed

**Git Commit Strategy:**
- Commit after each major update phase
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Keep related changes together
- Maintain clean commit history for tracking evolution

## Cross-Domain Pattern Indicators

When adding new content, watch for these patterns that suggest cross-domain significance:

**Recurring Themes:**
- Individual vs collective responsibility
- Prevention vs treatment approaches
- Visible vs effective solutions
- Tradeoff acceptance vs perfect solution seeking
- Leverage amplification vs democratization
- Capacity management and accumulation effects
- Recognition vs expression gaps
- Process vs outcome optimization

**Connection Signals:**
- Similar terminology across domains
- Parallel structures or mechanisms
- Opposing perspectives on shared challenges
- Evidence that contradicts or supports insights from other domains
- Policy or practical implications spanning multiple areas

## Future Development Opportunities

**Potential New Domains:**
- Education/Learning Systems
- Economics/Markets  
- Psychology/Behavior
- Urban Planning/Infrastructure
- International Relations/Geopolitics

**System Enhancements:**
- Automated cross-reference checking
- Visual network mapping of connections
- Temporal tracking of idea evolution
- Quantitative analysis of relationship strengths
- Article publication tracking and outcome measurement
