# LLM = interface & orchestrator; Tools = truth & calculation

The fundamental division of labor in effective AI systems: LLMs serve as interface and orchestrator while formal tools handle truth and calculation. This separation leverages each component's strengths while avoiding their weaknesses.

## Core Division of Responsibilities

**LLM Role: Interface & Orchestrator**
- Natural language understanding and generation
- Intent interpretation and task decomposition
- Tool selection and coordination
- Result synthesis and explanation
- User experience and conversation management

**Tool Role: Truth & Calculation**
- Precise mathematical computation
- Formal logical reasoning
- Data retrieval and validation
- Deterministic operations
- Provable, auditable results

## Why This Division Works

**Complementary Strengths**: LLMs excel at communication and flexibility; tools excel at precision and reliability
**Clear Boundaries**: Each component operates within its competency zone
**Fault Isolation**: Errors in one component don't contaminate the other
**Scalable Architecture**: Can add new tools without retraining the LLM
**Auditable Pipeline**: Tool outputs provide verification trail

## What LLMs Should NOT Do

**Mathematical Computation**: Delegate to calculators, symbolic math systems
**Data Storage/Retrieval**: Use databases, APIs, search systems
**Logical Proof**: Employ theorem provers, constraint solvers
**Exact Matching**: Utilize search engines, lookup tables
**Deterministic Algorithms**: Call appropriate computational libraries

## What Tools Should NOT Do

**Natural Language Generation**: LLMs handle user-facing communication
**Intent Interpretation**: LLMs parse human requests
**Creative Synthesis**: LLMs combine and explain tool results
**Context Management**: LLMs maintain conversation flow
**Ambiguity Resolution**: LLMs clarify unclear requests

## Implementation Patterns

**Clear Contracts**: Well-defined APIs between LLM and tools
**Type Safety**: Structured data exchange with validation
**Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when tools fail
**Provenance Tracking**: Chain of custody for all computations
**Result Verification**: LLM checks tool outputs for reasonableness

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**LLM Math**: Never let LLMs perform calculations they should delegate
**Tool Conversation**: Never let tools generate user-facing explanations
**Boundary Crossing**: Maintain strict separation of concerns
**Silent Failures**: Always handle and report tool errors
**Black Box Results**: Always provide computational provenance

## Strategic Implications

**Reliability Through Architecture**: System reliability comes from component separation, not component perfection
**Expertise Amplification**: Expert knowledge guides tool selection and result interpretation
**Maintainable Complexity**: Complex capabilities through simple, composable components
**Trust Through Transparency**: Users can verify tool-mediated results
