# ADHD Individuals Show Strong Justice Sensitivity

People with ADHD demonstrate heightened sensitivity to fairness and equality issues, experiencing strong emotional reactions when encountering unfair treatment or unequal situations.

## Core Pattern

**Justice Hypervigilance**: ADHD brains show increased sensitivity to perceived unfairness, triggering strong emotional responses
**Equality Focus**: Strong drive toward equal treatment and outcomes across situations and relationships
**Emotional Intensity**: Justice violations produce disproportionately strong anger and distress responses
**Advocacy Tendency**: Natural inclination to speak up against perceived unfairness, even when personally costly

## Neurological Connection

**Executive Function**: ADHD affects impulse control, making justice reactions harder to modulate
**Emotional Regulation**: Difficulty managing intense emotional responses to unfairness
**Social Sensitivity**: Heightened awareness of social dynamics and power imbalances
**Pattern Recognition**: Strong ability to spot inconsistencies in treatment or rule application
