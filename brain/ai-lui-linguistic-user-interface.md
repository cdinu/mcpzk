# LLMs function as Linguistic User Interface (LUI) to formal systems

LLMs function best as a *linguistic user interface*: they converse in human terms, then *delegate deep, precise work to formal tools* (computational languages, provers, simulators, databases), finally translating results back into human-understandable language.

> "LLMs are a linguistic user interface… when it needs deep computation, it calls a tool." -- paraphrasing Wolfram


LLMs work best as a linguistic user interface (LUI): they converse in human terms, delegate deep precise work to formal tools (computational languages, provers, simulators, databases), then translate results back into human-understandable language.


## Core Architecture Pattern

**Intent Capture**: Natural language input from humans  
**Grounding & Schema Mapping**: Convert to types, units, constraints  
**Tool Selection & Calls**: Delegate to APIs, computational languages, MCP servers  
**Result Checking**: Verify units, invariants, sanity bounds  
**Explanation & Summarization**: Translate formal results back to human language

**Mental Model**: LLM = interface & orchestrator; Tools = truth & calculation

## Key Advantages

**Separation of Concerns**: Broad shallow human-like reasoning (LLMs) separate from narrow deep formal reasoning (computation)
**Knowledge Tower Building**: Enables tall, stable knowledge systems without forcing humans to learn formal languages
**Reliability**: Pushes critical logic into deterministic tools while keeping LLM for user experience
**Auditability**: Provides provenance, units, and trace for computational results

## Design Patterns

**Typed Tool Contracts**: Strict input/output schemas, units, error codes
**Self-Checks**: LLM verifies invariants (dimensions, ranges) post-tool-call
**Explain-Then-Execute**: LLM outlines plan → runs tools → reconciles differences
**Cite & Show Work**: Include inputs, assumptions, and tool outputs in responses
**Deterministic Cores**: Push critical logic into tools; keep LLM for UX and coordination

## Anti-Patterns and Risks

**Pure-LLM Answers**: Using LLMs alone for tasks requiring exactness (math, finance, medicine)
**Schema Drift**: Tools change but prompts don't, creating silent failures
**Over-Anthropomorphizing**: Expecting LLMs to perform computationally irreducible work
**Opaque Outputs**: No provenance, units, or computational trace

## Implementation Requirements

**Capability Registry**: Tools + JSON schemas + examples
**Unit/Ontology Layer**: Dimensional analysis for sanity checking
**Provenance Logging**: Inputs, tool calls, outputs, verification hashes
**Fallback Mechanisms**: Retry with defaults, request missing fields, graceful degradation
**Evaluation Framework**: Golden tasks where answers must match tool truth exactly

## Open Questions and Limits

**Translation Gap**: Some formal results are not human-comprehensible due to computational irreducibility
**Interconcept Drift**: LLMs may fabricate concepts between "islands" of meaning
**Trust & UX**: What evidence bundle do users need to trust tool-mediated answers?
