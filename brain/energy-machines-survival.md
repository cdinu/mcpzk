# We need machines to live

Modern human survival depends fundamentally on machines that protect us from environmental threats. Machines provide temperature regulation, medical care, food preservation, and protection from natural dangers that would otherwise be lethal.

## Bibliography

- Epstein, Alex. *Fossil Future: Why Global Human Flourishing Requires More Oil, Coal, and Natural Gas - Not Less*

## Relationships
- **Supports**: [Energy is food for machines](energy-food-machines.md) - establishes why powering machines is a survival issue
- **Supports**: [Infrastructure makes Earth habitable](energy-infrastructure-habitable.md) - explains what specific machines accomplish for human habitability
- **Supports**: [Planet Earth unfriendly to humans](energy-earth-hostile-environment.md) - provides concrete examples of how machines protect us
- **Related**: [Climate often against humans](energy-climate-hostile.md)
- **Examples**: Incubators for premature babies, air conditioning in extreme heat, heating in cold climates, medical diagnostic equipment
- **Extends to**: Agricultural machinery, water treatment systems, transportation safety systems

## Article Potential
- **Angle**: Counter the romantic notion of "returning to nature" by showing how dependent modern humans are on technological life support
- **Hook**: "Take away our machines, and most of us would be dead within days"
- **After reading**: Readers gain appreciation for the technology that makes modern life possible and safe
- **Evidence needed**: Statistics on mortality rates in pre-industrial vs. industrial societies, specific examples of life-saving technologies
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments about over-reliance on technology and "natural" living

## Article 2 Potential
- **Angle**: Explore how machine dependence shapes human evolution and society
- **Hook**: "Are we becoming cyborgs without realizing it?"
- **After reading**: Readers understand how technology dependency has become integrated into human civilization
- **Evidence needed**: Research on human adaptation to technological environments, dependency patterns across cultures
- **Counter-arguments**: Address concerns about technological dependency creating vulnerability

## Cross-Domain Connections
