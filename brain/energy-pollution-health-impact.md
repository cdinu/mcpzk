# Air pollution from energy shortens lives

Air pollution from energy production kills millions of people annually worldwide and reduces life expectancy for residents of polluted cities by several years. This represents a significant health externality of energy systems that is often underestimated in policy discussions.

## Bibliography

- EdX Course ENGSCI137x Introduction video

## Relationships
- **Conflicts**: [Fossil is most accessible energy source](energy-fossil-accessible.md) - highlights health costs of fossil fuel accessibility
- **Conflicts**: [Public discourse ignores fossil benefits](energy-discourse-fossil-benefits.md) - provides example of costs that discourse does acknowledge
- **Supports**: [Energy involves cost-climate tradeoffs](energy-cost-climate-tradeoffs.md) - demonstrates health costs in the tradeoff equation
- **Related**: [Environment more than just climate](energy-environment-broader.md)
- **Examples**: Respiratory disease rates in coal-dependent regions, cardiovascular impacts in urban areas with high vehicle emissions
- **Extends to**: Indoor air quality, occupational health in energy industries, environmental justice issues

## Article Potential
- **Angle**: Quantify the hidden health costs of different energy systems for better policy comparison
- **Hook**: "The silent killer powered by our energy choices"
- **After reading**: Readers understand how to include health externalities in energy policy decisions
- **Evidence needed**: Comparative health impact studies across energy sources, economic analysis of health costs, air quality monitoring data
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments about economic benefits outweighing health costs, technological solutions for pollution control

## Article 2 Potential
- **Angle**: Explore environmental justice dimensions of energy-related health impacts
- **Hook**: "Why the poor pay with their lungs for our energy choices"
- **After reading**: Readers understand how energy decisions create unequal health burdens
- **Evidence needed**: Demographic analysis of pollution exposure, income correlation with air quality, case studies of environmental justice
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments about economic development benefits for disadvantaged communities

## Cross-Domain Connections
- **Health**: Respiratory medicine, cardiovascular health, public health policy
- **Politics**: Environmental justice, regulatory policy, healthcare costs
- **Technology**: Air quality monitoring, pollution control technology, clean energy alternatives
