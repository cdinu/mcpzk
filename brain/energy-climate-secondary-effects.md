# Climate change secondary effects

The most significant problems from climate change are not the primary physical effects, but the secondary disruptions to human systems. These include disrupted supply chains, displaced populations, and conflicts that impede society's ability to address other critical challenges.

## Relationships
- **Supports**: [Climate increases nuclear war risk](energy-climate-war-risk.md) - provides specific example of secondary effects
- **Related**: [CO2 persists thousands of years](energy-co2-persistence.md) - explains why long-term secondary effects matter
- **Related**: [Climate often against humans](energy-climate-hostile.md) - distinguishes natural from human-caused climate challenges
- **Examples**: Extreme weather disrupting supply chains, climate migration creating conflicts, resource scarcity affecting international relations
- **Extends to**: Systemic risk analysis, resilience planning, indirect impact assessment

## Article Potential
- **Angle**: Shift climate focus from physical effects to systemic disruptions and adaptation challenges
- **Hook**: "Climate change won't kill you directly - here's what will"
- **After reading**: Readers understand why climate adaptation and resilience matter more than specific temperature changes
- **Evidence needed**: Systems analysis of climate impacts, case studies of secondary effects, resilience research
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments that primary effects are sufficient motivation for action

## Article 2 Potential
- **Angle**: Explore how secondary effects create policy priorities different from primary effect focus
- **Hook**: "Why climate policy should focus on resilience, not just emissions"
- **After reading**: Readers understand alternative approaches to climate policy based on adaptation and resilience
- **Evidence needed**: Comparative policy analysis, adaptation vs. mitigation effectiveness, resilience economics
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments that mitigation prevents the need for adaptation

## Cross-Domain Connections
- **Politics**: Systemic risk management, international security, migration policy
- **Productivity**: Supply chain resilience, business continuity planning, risk management
- **Health**: Public health emergency preparedness, healthcare system resilience
