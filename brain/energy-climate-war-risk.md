# Climate increases nuclear war risk

Climate change increases the risk of nuclear war and pandemics by creating resource scarcity, population displacement, and international tensions that can escalate into larger conflicts or overwhelm public health systems.

## Bibliography

- Personal analysis connecting climate impacts to security risks

## Relationships
- **Supports**: [Climate change secondary effects](energy-climate-secondary-effects.md) - provides specific examples of dangerous secondary effects
- **Related**: [CO2 emissions affect world everywhere](energy-co2-global-impact.md) - shows how global problems create international tensions
- **Examples**: Water scarcity conflicts, climate migration overwhelming neighboring countries, agricultural failures destabilizing governments
- **Extends to**: National security analysis, international relations, risk assessment frameworks

## Article Potential
- **Angle**: Explore climate change as a "threat multiplier" that increases risks of catastrophic conflicts
- **Hook**: "The climate war that could end civilization"
- **After reading**: Readers understand how environmental changes can trigger much more dangerous secondary crises
- **Evidence needed**: Security studies research, historical examples of environmental conflicts, military analysis of climate risks
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments that direct cooperation will prevent climate-related conflicts

## Article 2 Potential
- **Angle**: Examine whether climate resilience is more important than emission reduction for preventing conflicts
- **Hook**: "Building walls or cutting emissions: which prevents climate wars?"
- **After reading**: Readers understand different approaches to managing climate-related security risks
- **Evidence needed**: Comparative analysis of adaptation vs. mitigation for conflict prevention, resilience studies
- **Counter-arguments**: Address arguments that addressing root causes (emissions) is more effective than treating symptoms

## Cross-Domain Connections
- **Politics**: National security, international relations, conflict prevention
- **Health**: Pandemic preparedness, public health security, disease surveillance
- **AI**: Risk assessment models, security intelligence, conflict prediction systems
